NOTE:
On David Rakowski’s website, he says: “At this point, I’m no longer interested
in the care and feeding of typefaces, and am ignoring any e-mails about fonts
that come my way. Y’all may continue to do what you wish with the shareware
fonts, and send money to Columbia University if you feel that is what you must
do. Me, I’ve got symphonies to write and cats to feed.”
